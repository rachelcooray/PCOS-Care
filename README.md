# PCOS Care: A Web Application for Diagnosing PCOS Using Machine Learning

## **Overview**  
PCOS Care is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using machine learning. The platform allows users to input their health data, receive a risk assessment, and access educational resources about PCOS.  

## **Features**  
1. User-friendly interface for entering health data  
2. Machine learning-based PCOS risk prediction   
3. Visualization of results  
4. Educational content on PCOS symptoms, causes, and management  

## **Tech Stack Used**  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Random Forest/SVM)  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## **Installation**  

1. **Download the ZIP file** of the project and extract it.  
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:  
   ```bash
   cd PCOS-Care/frontend
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit application:  
   ```bash

   ```

This will launch the web application in your browser.

## **Usage**  
1. Open the web application in your browser.  
2. Enter your health data (e.g., symptoms, medical history).  
3. Click **Submit** to get a predicted PCOS risk assessment.  
4. View results and access educational resources.
